BlinkenTiles
============

BlinkenTiles is a highly versatile and interactive installation which allows for users to make music with their own body. This is achieved by using a sound matrix projected onto the ground. Users are then tracked via a Microsoft Kinect and a sound is played depending on their location on the matrix. The corresponding software was developed in Unity3D, using OpenCV/EmguCV and C#.
